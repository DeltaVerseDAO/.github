DeltaVerse DAO (c) <a href="https://deltav.exchange">DeltaV THRUST</a> purchased deltaverse.dao deltavthrust.coin deltavthrust.wallet deltavthrust.nft

  These IPFS unstoppable NFT domains are a one time fee / hold forever. deltaverse.dao becomes immortal with a proper setup on IPFS and creates a DAO template that will stand the test of time. Ownership of these domains transitions DeltaV THRUST from web2 to web3. Pay once own forever. DeltaV THRUST has become an immutable company. Further transitions to complete holder control and DAO management are ongoing.

 #DeltaVerse DAO starmap to do

1) create AIRDROP system / Batch Send Signature Based Claiming system for smartBNB holder rewards

issues include a) signature based claiming b) bulk airdrop from one to many c) creation of wallet contract to hold sales fees prior to holder distribution

2) create weighted voting system to allocate direction of the marketing and development funds accumulated by <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x969F60Bfe17962E0f061B434596545C7b6Cd6Fc4?a=0x34007ca21e12d1d31eaea468f8f1639e6465508b">PULSAR</a>

issues include a) ensure that the voting mechanism cannot be gamed b) provide weighted power based on allocation of <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x969F60Bfe17962E0f061B434596545C7b6Cd6Fc4#balances">team / holder</a> shares in a fair and equitable manner with a continued vision of the long game

3) create weighted voting to allow the holders the choice of reciving 22.2% smartBNB rewards or allocating portions of the rewards to marketing and / or development

a) default setting will be to pay out to the holders the entire sum of the 22% sales fee. It is believed that this will create a holder incentive.

4) release next iteration of dAPP

a) first release will be a landing page
b) updates to release will include cross chain bridge
c) updates to release will include onramp system from fiat to <a href="https://deltav.exchange">THRUST</a>
