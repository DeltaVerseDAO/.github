 # <a href="https://github.com/DeltaVerseDAO">DeltaVerse DAO</a> starmap to do

1) create <a href="https://github.com/thrustdrop">AIRDROP</a> system / Batch Send Signature Based Claiming system for smartBNB holder rewards

issues include a) signature based claiming b) bulk airdrop from one to many c) creation of wallet contract to hold sales fees prior to holder distribution

2) create weighted voting system to allocate direction of the marketing and development funds accumulated by <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x969F60Bfe17962E0f061B434596545C7b6Cd6Fc4?a=0x34007ca21e12d1d31eaea468f8f1639e6465508b">PULSAR</a>

issues include a) ensure that the voting mechanism cannot be gamed b) provide weighted power based on allocation of <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x969F60Bfe17962E0f061B434596545C7b6Cd6Fc4#balances">team / holder</a> shares in a fair and equitable manner with a continued vision of the long game

3) create weighted voting to allow the holders the choice of reciving 22.2% smartBNB rewards or allocating portions of the rewards to marketing and / or development

a) default setting will be to pay out to the holders the entire sum of the 22% sales fee. It is believed that this will create a holder incentive.

4) release next iteration of dAPP

a) first release will be a landing page
b) updates to release will include cross chain bridge
c) updates to release will include onramp system from fiat to <a href="https://deltav.exchange">THRUST</a>

Currently the <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x969F60Bfe17962E0f061B434596545C7b6Cd6Fc4?a=0x34007ca21e12d1d31eaea468f8f1639e6465508b">PULSAR</a> wallet is locked in a 2/3 voting system for changes. The <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x34007ca21E12D1d31EAeA468f8f1639E6465508b#code">PULSAR lock</a> is your guarantee that the TEAM will never SELL from the <a href="https://deltav.exchange">THRUST</a> team relections wallet. Required is the provision for an active party to exit the DAO where a replacement team member would emerge. This project is codenamed <a href="https://github.com/DeltaVerseDAO/deadman-switch">"deadmanswitch"</a>. As a secondary utility <a href="https://github.com/DeltaVerseDAO/deadman-switch">DeadmanSwitch</a> will prove useful in both will and estate contracts. PULSAR will never sell. Assets from PULSAR may be used to create more liquidity pairs in the future as the <a href="https://deltav.exchange">DeltaV THRUST</a> project expands. Assets from PULSAR may be included in staking pools for holder staking payout incentives. PULSAR has become the locked team wallet. Reflections from sales of <a href="https://deltav.exchange">DeltaV THRUST</a> will be allocated to the holders and the team based on percentage of holdings. The TEAM DAO controls the reflections rewards granted to the PULSAR wallet to facilitate communty marketing and development. As the <a href="https://deltav.exchange">THRUST</a> project expands the TEAM DAO will include a balanced vote to include holder input. Holding <a href="https://deltav.exchange">THRUST = POWER</a> over the future direction of <a href="https://deltav.exchange">THRUST</a> as an immutable company. Hold a minimum of 22000 THRUST to recieve all sales fees in smartBNB and feel the power of a truly <a href="https://github.com/deltav-deltaverse">decentralized future</a>. <a href="https://deltav.exchange">DeltaV THRUST</a> is a smartBNB reflections token on the Binance Smart Chain.
